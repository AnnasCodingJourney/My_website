        I am a passionate knitter. This hobby underlines many of the character traits above.<br>
        Knitting is like coding: Starting with a ball of yarn and some needles and doing row by row until a project is compelted.<br>
        On the way you may face challenges and encounter new techniques that you will have to look up and practice. <br>
        Sometimes, you will make mistakes and will have to undo rows, but you learn from that and can apply these skills to <br>
        new project. This requires patience, passion, creativity, ambition, dedication and hard-work.<br>
        Coding is similar: In your IDE you usually start with a blank page. You type your code row by row, until your project is completed.<br>
        You will face challenges, will have to look things up, delete code and rewrite it...It's a learning process.
